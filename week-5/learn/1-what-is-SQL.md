# What is SQL? 

SQL is the most commonly used language for manipulating relational databases and is comprised of three sub-languages.

1. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - This populates, updates and queries relational databases 
2. Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - Defines relations / tables for Relational Databases (RDB)
3. Data Control Language 
  - Manages users, user profiles and privileges 

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) was covered in week 4 (CREATE TABLE, FOREIGN KEY, PRIMARY KEY etc.) for implementing database design in SQL. 

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

This will bbe covered this week and will is used to implement and alter the tuples within a table / relation. 

## Data Control Language (DCL)

Beyond the scope of this course, and is usually used by database administrators.
It is a declarative database language , not a general purpose programming languages. 
All of its constructs are primarily userd for manipulating tables, rows, columns, database schemes/ structures and users. 

# SQL Standards

There are multiple SQL standards. 

Among them 

- SQL-92 (SQL-2) and SQL-99(SQL3)
  - The most widely used, SQL-92 is still regarded as up to date. 
  - Different vendors implement them to certain levels of compliances, however, for example Oracle 81 is SQL2 compliant, while Oracle 91/10g/11g/12c and newer versions are now SQL3 compliant

SQL is purely declarative, as the user specifies what needs to be done rather than how it should be done 
Procedural extensions of SQL do exist bbut they are vendor-specific

For example. Oracle PL/SQL, Microsoft Transact SQL, Informix 4GL, and so on.
