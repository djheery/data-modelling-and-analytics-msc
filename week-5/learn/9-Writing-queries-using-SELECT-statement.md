# Writing Queries using the SELECT statement

There are variations of the SQL query templates, which support the implementation of relational algebra operations through varying different clauses in the statement. 

- SELECT 
  - The SELECT clause can explicitly point at the require columns. Alternatively, it can contain teh special * symbol, which projects full rows without moving any columns. 
- FROM 
  - The FROM clause can contain more than one table, which allows you to implement both unary and binary operations. 
- where 
  - The WHERE clause in the statement can be used to restrict the rows to be selected using additional conditions on the columns
