# SQL Database Manipulation Language (DML) and its uses

For querying and manipulating relational databases, its constructs are recognized by the first keyword:

SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE 

## SELECT 

The SELECT statements implement the relational algebra * 1 (A formal relations manipulating language proposed by e.f. codd in 1970)

All relational algebra operations can be expressed in a standard SQL implementation using SELECT statements only. 

## INSERT 

INSERT statements are used to populate a database by adding tuples to relations of an RDB. 

## UPDATE 

UPDATE statements are used to update a database by amending some of the attributes of the existing tuples within relations of the relational database. 

## DELETE 

DELETE statements are used to update a database by removing tuples from relations of an RDB.
