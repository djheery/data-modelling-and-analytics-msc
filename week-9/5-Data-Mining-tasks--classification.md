# Data Mining Tasks: Classification

The task of classifying or mapping given data into already known classes is called classification or supervised learning (Dunham, 2003). The algorithms used for classification are often called classifiers. 

In classification or supervised learning, the algorithm uses a set of classified examples (often called training dataset) to learn a way of classifying unseen and unclassified examples (often called testing dataset) (Witten et al., 2011).
