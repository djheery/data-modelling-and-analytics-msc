# DM Tasks - Clustering 

Clustering is similar to classification. The difference, however, is that classification maps values to known classes or groups whereas in clustering, target groups are not predefined but rather determined by the values being clustered (Dunham, 2003). This is why clustering is also known as unsupervised learning.

Numerous clustering algorithms exist in the literature and many have been implemented in DM tools. For example, consider the same weather dataset (Weiss, n.d.). 

Clustering is used to see if two clusters can be found just like the two classes for play attribute (‘yes’ or ‘no’). Note that the weather dataset contains nine ‘yes’ and five ‘no’.
