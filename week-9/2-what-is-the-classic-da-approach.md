# What is the Classic Data Analytics Approach 

## Data Warehouses 

A Data warehouse can be used for a range of data analysis. This includes traditional DB queries. But most often they are used using online analytical processing (OLAP)

**Online Analytical Processing** OLAP 

OLAP supports much more complex queries than traditional DB queries.

An example of this is: 

Compare sales of product P403 relative to past by quater and sales region for the past 2 years

## Traditional Discovery Driven Enquiry of Databases 

A discovery driven approach deals with unknown data to provide insights into data that cannot bbe easily obbtained with DB/OLAP queries 

In contrast to Traditional Database Access, the discovery-driven approach is different in regard to how query (Q) is expressed, what sort of data (D) is accesed from a database (DB) and what sort of result is produced (R)

The discovery driven approach is used when the user may not be able to express the query Q in SQL. 
This may be because the user does not know precisely what they want to see or what they are looking for in the data. 
It is Unknown. 

The data D is not the same as the DB but often an extracted portion of the DB, which is cleaned, transformed, aggregated and restructured in a format suitable for the discovery process. 

The result R is not a subset of DB but rather inferred/predicted/derived from an analysis of D.
In otherwords R is also unknown, hidden within the DB and not possibble to be obtained through traditional query approach. 

In other words Discovery driven approach to data analytics is used when you want to gain insight on your data that is not merely the data itself. Patterns and trends that may suggest an answer.
