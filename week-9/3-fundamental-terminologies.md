# Fundamental Terminologies, Definitions and History of Data Analytics / Data mining 

## Data Mining 

Below are a few definitions of data mining: 

According to Simoudis (1996, p.26):

'Te process of extractive valid, previously unknown comprehensibble, and actionalble information from large databases and using it to make crucial business decisions' 

laudon and Laudon (2019, p.265)

Data mining provides insights into corporate data... by finding hidden patterns and relationships in large databbases and inferring rules from them to predict future bvehaviour' 

## Business Intelligence 

According to Sarda et al. (2018, p.42)

Business intelligence 'combines architectures, tools, databases, analytical tools, applications and methodologies.. the process of BI is based on the transformation of data to information, then to decisions, and finally to actions' 

Data mining, business intelligence and 'data analytics' can be used interchangeably, according to Elmasri and Navate (2017, p.1009)

Other terms used in conjunction with data mining and analytics are 'machine learning' and 'data science' 

## Machine Learning 

Machine learning is a facet of AI that concerns developing programmes/ algorithms that can learn and is often used for prediction or classification.

According to DSTL, machine learning is a 'field that aims to provide computer systems with the ability to learn and improve automatically without having to be explicitly programmed'

## Data Science

Data science is a ‘multidisciplinary field that combines statistics, mathematics, computer science and domain expertise to extract relevant insights or knowledge from data’ (DSTL, 2019, p.5).
