# Sequential Analysis 

Sequential analysis or sequence discovery is used to find out sequential or chronological patterns in data in temporal order. 

Temporal order means that these patterns occur in a time sequence of actions or events. 
Although these patterns may be seen as similar to association rules, here the difference is that these relationships are based on time. 

There are numerous applications of sequential analysis
An example may be in the retail business sector where a customer buys products one after another over a period of time, or in the service-oriented business sector where a customer buys car insurance and later buys breakdown cover. 

Although several algorithms concerning sequential analysis exist, our chosen tool, WEKA, odoes not support any such algorithm, which is why this task could not be demonstrated.
