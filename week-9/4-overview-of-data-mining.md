# Overview of Data Mining 

In data mining you use different algorithms to fit a model to the input data. 
These Data mining algorithms examine the input data and then find a model that captures the characteristics of the input data. 

The model created by DM can be classified as predictive of descriptive, each with its own typical DM tasks as shown in following 

DATA MINING 
  - Predictive 
    - The predictive model predicts new values based on known results or historical data, for example known behaviour of a telecom company's past customers who have moved to another supplier (a phenomenon known as **customer churn**) can be used to predict the behaviour of existing customers so that the company may do something to retain those **churn-prone** customers
    - This leads to these algorithms: 
      - Classification 
      - Regression 
      - Prediction 
  - Descriptive 
    - The descriptive model discovers patterns or relationships among data, it explores the characteristics of the given data rather than predicting any new values or characteristics 
    - This leads to 
      - Clustering 
      - Association Rules 
      - Sequential Analysis
