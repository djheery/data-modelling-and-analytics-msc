# DM Task: Association Rules 

Association uncovers hidden relationships among data - in the form of rules. 
Alternative terminologies exist, for example, link analysis or affinity analysis 

An association rule models specific data associations, for example, from the weather dataset, we can identify (Witten et. al. 2011): 

If outlook = sunny and humidity > 83 then play = no

If outlook = sunny and humidity > 83 then play = no

Here the use of association rules in WEKA are demonstrated using the Apriori algorithm on the weather dataset (Weiss, n.d.). 

The following output below shows ten association rules.
