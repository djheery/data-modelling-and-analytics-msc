# Implementing vs Designing a Database 

Take a moment to consider this question:

*What makes implementing a database different from designing it?*

My answer: 

Where designing a database considers, the entity types, relationships and attributes that may exist in a database and their associated constraints. The implementation of a database uses the design to build the "physical" database and considers much more directly the use of the database by a user from a "physical" standpoint.

The given answer: 

**Designing** A database involves making decisions abbout what relations are required to hold the data needed by users and the information system that the database serves. 
**Implementing** a database involves creating suitable tables for realising these relations using a data definition language of the targe database management system (Such as SQL)
