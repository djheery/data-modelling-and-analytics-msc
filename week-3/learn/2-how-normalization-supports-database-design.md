# How Normalization Supports Database Design

Normalization can be used as a formal technique at any stage of database design.
This session focuses on how normalization is used as a bottom up standalone database design technique. 

Normalization can be used as a validation technique to check the structure of relations, which may have been produced using ER modelling. 

As a top-down approach, the purpose of normalization is always the same: 

- Creating a set of suitable relations that meet the data requirements of the enterprise. 

The users' requirements specification is considered the preferred data source. 
This is not the only data source, other sources such as forms and reports are used to design a database. 

## Approaches

**Bottom Up**: Use Normalization to create the set of relations, informed but the users requirements. 
**Top Down**: Create an ER model of the database requirements and map them to relations then use normalization as a validation technique to check the structure of the realtions.
