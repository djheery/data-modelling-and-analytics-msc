# Build Conceptual Data Model 

To build a conceptual data model of the data requirements of an enterprise you must asses the needs of said enterprise. 

A conceptual data model comprises of: 

- Entity Types
- Relationship types 
- Attributes and Attribute Domains 
- Primary keys and Alternate Keys 
- Integrity constraints 

The conceptual data model is supported by documentation including ERD and a data dictionary, which is produced through the development of the model.
