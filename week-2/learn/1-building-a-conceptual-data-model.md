# Building a Conceptual data model 

This session is dedicated to building a conceptual data model, an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for the data requirements of an enterprise. 
A conceptual model comprises entity types, relationship types, attribute domains, primary and alternate keys, and integrity constraints, and comprises six key steps. 

1. Determine the entity types 
2. Determine relationship types among the entity types 
3. Determine attributes for entity and/or relationship types from steps 1 and 2
4. Revise and rationalize entity and relationship types and attributes 
5. Determine domains/ data types for attributes from step 3 and 4
6. For each entity type choose candidate, primary and alternate key attributes
