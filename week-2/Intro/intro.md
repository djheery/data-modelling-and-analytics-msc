# Week 2

## Learning: 
  - Understand the basics of developing a conceptual model 
    - Get to know the process of analysing data requirements 
    - Derive building blocks of entity relationship diagram 
    - Develop ERD for a sample system / data requirements
  - Understand the basics of producing a logical database design
    - Get to know the process of converting / mapping a conceptual model into a logical database design 
  - Derive a logical database design from a conceptual model 
    - Apply the logical database design process to a sample conceptual model 
    - Examine the steps of how an ERD is converted to a set of relations 

## Lab
  - Part 1: Produce a conceptual model in the form of an ERD for a flights management system 
  - Part 2: Produce a logical design of the database from the conceptual model of part 1 using relational mapping 

## Post lab tasks
  - Self assesment quiz
  - In the lab part, you will have produced an ERD for the FMS, and then will have converted it to produce a logical database design as a set of relations. Review alternative conceptual and logical databbase design methods and discuss and justify why or why not to use the approach you have used in the lab part in the future for another system
