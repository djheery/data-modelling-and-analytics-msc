# Using ODM 

There are two different ways that you can use ODM in this module using resources available at the university and possibly on your own devices. 

In order to use both of these methods, you will require a special data mining user account.
To create and set up a user with the correct credentials requires some DBA level knowledge and above all, it requires access to the password of the god of every Oracle database – the SYS super-user. 

Therefore, IT technicians will create the required users and provide you with details (for example, a user name like DLDMU1), which you will use for experimenting and practising with ODM and as part of the assessment for this module.

## SQL and PL/SQL API 

The simplest and less resource hungry way to use ODM is by using the SQL Plus client you have been using so far with a mix of SQL and PL/SQL

## SQL Developer with Oracle Data Miner GUI 

The easiest and most efficient way to use ODM is through Oracle’s SQL Developer software with a graphical workflow facility known as Oracle Data Miner GUI. This requires downloading a zipped folder of the SQL Developer, unpacking it and running it off your One Drive (Berger, 2013; Surampudi, 2020b).

You will view a demo of the Oracle Data Miner GUI method in the Apply section under the Lab section of the VLE.
