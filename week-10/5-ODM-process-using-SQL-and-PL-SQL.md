# ODM Process using SQL and PL/SQL API 

1. Define the Problem 
  - Generally speaking, you will have a nontrivial probblem to solve that requires the application of data mining or predictive analytics. Therefore, before you embark on data mining you will need to have difined the problem 
2. Identify Data 
  - This involves identifying what build-data will be used for building the DM model, what test-data will beused for testing the model and what apply-data will be used for applying the model 
3. Define Model's Attributes 
  - This involves creating and populating a table for setting your target model's attribbutes 
4. Create Model 
  - This involves creating a DM model using suitable ODM algorithm based on the predefined data build
5. Test The Model 
  - This concerns testing the DM model with a predefined test0data and determining its accuracy 
6. Apply the Model 
  - Now applying the DM model to a predefined apply-data
