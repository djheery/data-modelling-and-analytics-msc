# ODM Process Example 

# Step 1 Identify The data

The recommended way to identify data is to create virtual views that pick certain subsets of the base data. 
These views are used at the time of creating, testing and applying the DM models. 

The views can be used for different models, for example, if you campare the performance of different models on the same dataset 

The data for the affinity card example comes from the SH data warehouse using the following views: 

- Mining_data_build_v (build-data)
- Mining_data_test_v (test-data)
- Mining_data_apply_v (apply-data)

The code in SQL and PL/SQL API for the affinity card example is: 

CREATE VIEW mining_data_test_v AS

SELECT 

 a.cust_id, a.cust_gender, 2003-a.cust_year_of_birth age,

 a.cust_marital_status, c.country_name, a.cust_income_level,

 b.education, b.occupation, b.household_size, b.yrs_residence,

 b.affinity_card, b.bulk_pack_diskettes, b.flat_panel_monitor,

 b.home_theater_package, b.bookkeeping_application,

 b.printer_supplies, b.y_box_games, b.os_doc_set_kanji

FROM

 sh.customers a,

 sh.supplementary_demographics b,

 sh.countries c

WHERE

 a.cust_id = b.cust_id AND 

 a.country_id  = c.country_id AND 

 a.cust_id between 103001 and 104500;

 Where ‘a.cust_id between 103001 and 104500;’ is a subset, that is, out of all the customers, those having their customer IDs from 103001 to 104500 will be used for testing the DM model.

## Step 2: Create and Populate a Table to Set Target Model Attributes 

Once you have identified the data, the next step is to create and populate a table to set target model attributes.
You need to create a table that the model will need at the build time and then populate this table with the settings you need

For the affinity card example, you need to specify SVM, by default, naive Bayes is used for classification. Also specify automatic data preparation (ADP), since by default, ADP is not used.

The code in SQL and PL/SQL API for the affinity card example is: 

REM Create the settings table 

CREATE TABLE svm_model_settings (

  setting_name  VARCHAR2(30),

  setting_value VARCHAR2(30));

REM Populate the settings table

BEGIN 

  INSERT INTO svm_model_settings VALUES

     (dbms_data_mining.algo_name,  

      dbms_data_mining.algo_support_vector_machines);

  INSERT INTO svm_model_settings  VALUES

   (dbms_data_mining.prep_auto,

    dbms_data_mining.prep_auto_on);

  COMMIT;

END;

/

## Step 3: Create a DM model using any of the ODM algorithims with predefined training Data 

Now you need to create the model using PL/SQL package called DBMS_DAT_MINING and the CREATE_MODEL procedure 

For the affinity card example, yolu need to specify that the model will use the ODM function for classification, the training date to be specified by the mining_data_build_v and the settings will come from the given SVM_MODEL_SETTINGS table. 

The code in SQL and PL/SQL API for the affinity card example is: 

REM Create the model using the specified settings

BEGIN

  DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL(

    model_name          => 'svm_model',

    mining_function     => dbms_data_mining.classification,

    data_table_name     => 'mining_data_build_v',

    case_id_column_name => 'cust_id',

    target_column_name  => 'affinity_card',

    settings_table_name => 'svm_model_settings');

END;

/

## Step 4: Test the DM model with predefined test data and determine its accuracy

To test the model, run the PREDICTION function using a predefined subset of the base data as well as calculate the total number of possible values. 
For the affinity card example, the model test results are calculated based on the view mining_data_test_v

For more information about the prediction function, refer to the ‘Prediction’ tab of the ‘SQL Language Reference’ webpage, which can be found under the Explore section of the VLE on the page titled: Essential reading and further resources.

REM testing the model

SELECT affinity_card AS actual_target_value,

       PREDICTION(svm_model USING *) AS predicted_target_value,

       COUNT(*) AS total_value

FROM mining_data_test_v

GROUP BY affinity_card, PREDICTION(svm_model USING *)

ORDER BY 1, 2;

REM RESULTS

To calculate the model’s accuracy, run the PREDICTION function on the model using a predefined subset of the base data to find out the sum of the correct values against the total number of cases. For the affinity card example, the model’s accuracy is calculated based on the view mining_data_test_v.

REM calculating the model's accuracy

COLUMN ACCURACY FORMAT 99.99

SELECT (SUM(correct)/COUNT(*))*100  AS accuracy

FROM  (SELECT DECODE(affinity_card,

                   PREDICTION(svm_model USING *), 1, 0) AS correct

               FROM mining_data_test_v);

REM RESULT

ACCURACY

--------

 81.93  

## Step 5: Apply the DM model to a predefined apply-data 

Next, use the PREDICTION_PROBABILITY function over the DM model to identify the cases from the predefined subset of the base data with a high probability of being a member of the target class.

For the affinity card example, apply the model to identify the ten customers (and display their names and IDs) who live in USA that are most likely to use an affinity card among the subset of the base data defined by the view mining_data_apply_v.

For more information about the prediction probability function, refer to the ‘Prediction probability’ tab of the ‘SQL Language Reference’ webpage, which can be found under the Explore section of the VLE on the page titled: Essential reading and further resources. 

REM first create the view to identify the customers    

CREATE VIEW TOP10_USA_Customers AS

SELECT cust_id

FROM (SELECT cust_id, rank() over (order by  

        PREDICTION_PROBABILITY(svm_model, 1 USING *)          

                    DESC, cust_id) RNK

      FROM mining_data_apply_v

      WHERE country_name = 'United States of America')

WHERE RNK <= 10

ORDER BY RNK;

REM now display the customers’ names

SELECT CUST_ID, 

   CUST_FIRST_NAME || ' '||  CUST_LAST_NAME AS CUST_NAME

FROM SH.CUSTOMERS

WHERE CUST_ID IN (SELECT * FROM TOP10_USA_Customers);

 

SQL> REM now display their details

SQL> SELECT CUST_ID, CUST_FIRST_NAME || ' '||  CUST_LAST_NAME AS CUST_NAME

  2  FROM SH.CUSTOMERS

  3  WHERE CUST_ID IN (SELECT * FROM TOP10_USA_Customers);

   CUST_ID CUST_NAME

## Getting DM models' metadata 

Oracle provides a data dictionary view 'user_mining_models' for obtaining information about DM models that are available in the database. 

SELECT mining_function, algorithm, model_name

FROM user_mining_models

ORDER BY mining_function;
