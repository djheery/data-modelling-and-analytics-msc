# Oracle Data Mining (ODM)

The Oracle Data Mining process is the principle of 'moving the algorithms to the data' rather than moving the data to the algorithms.
In this circumstance the algorithm could be an external data mining/ analytical tool. 

ODM eliminates the steps of extraction and transport of data. 

This means that data stays at home, so there is no risk of a data leak or misuse or mishandling. 

Data Mining (DM) models are first-class citizens of the Oracle database, hence under full control of the database administrator (DBA).
This ensures data security. 

Another advantage of ODM is that there are no limiting factors on the size of the dataset. It enables real 'big data analytics'. 
In ODM data mining occurs in the database kernel, which allows it to deliver high performance and scalability.
