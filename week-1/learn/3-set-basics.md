# Set Basics 

It is important to note that there is no ordering of a set:

{1, 2, 3, 4} === {1, 3, 4, 2} === {4, 3, 2, 1}

Further more there are no duplicates in a set: 

{1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2} === {4, 3, 2, 1}

The following students set is the set of people in a particular office.

Students = {Andy, Carl, William, Sarah, Andy} === {Andy, Carl, William, Sarah}

Note how there are 2 Andy's but there are no duplicates making only one 

## A Set is a container 

Sets are containers likened to a Bucket or a Box.
Boxes can contain other boxes or other buckets and vise versa

Sets can contain other sets:

{{Dave, Heather}, {Andy}, {Paul, Andy}}

Note that the below is **NOT** equal to the above:

{Dave, Heather, Andy, Paul}

This is because of the containers. This is in the same way

{{1, 2}, {3}} !== {1, 2, 3} !== {{1}, {2}, {3}}

## Null Sets

A nulls set has no members and is written like: 

{} or âˆ…

Null sets can be useful. A set can be finite so that all of its elements can be listed. In fact all the sets you have seen so far are finite 

You can have infinite sets. Obviously all the elements of an infinite set cannot be listed 
Instead you can specify an infinite set using mathematical formulae

For example the set of even, positive, whole numbers: 

Evens = {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}

This is a simple example of set comprehension, more to be explored further along in the session.
