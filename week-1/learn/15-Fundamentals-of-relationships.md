# Fundamentals of Relationships 

## Relationship Degree

This represents the number of participating entity types in a relationship. A relationship type with 3 participating entity types is called **ternary**

## Recursive Relationship 

A Relationship type between the same participating entity type in distict roles, is called a recursive or a self-referencing relationship type. 

## Attribute(s) of a Relationship Type

You can record more details about a relationship in the form of attributes. 

## Constraints of Relationship Type 

Also known as relationship constraints, the cardinality (measure of a sets size, meaning the number of elements in a set) specifies maximum participation. 

The variations of this are as follows: 

- One to One (1:1)
- One to Many (1:N) or Many to One (N:1)
- Many to Many (M:N)
- Existence dependency constraint (This specifies the minimum participation in a relationship type) Also known as a participation constraint 
  - Zero or single (optional participation, not existence-dependent)
  - One or more or double line (Mandatory participation, existence-dependant)

## Weak Entity Types 

Entity Types without key attributes or whose existence depends on another entity type as in the case of DEPENDENT entity type, see Further readinG for more details
