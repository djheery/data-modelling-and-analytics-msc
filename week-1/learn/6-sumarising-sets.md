# Summarizing Sets

You have learned about sets 
A set is a container for objects of some type 

It can be defined by listing the elements (enumeration) or by a formula (usually set comprehension)

Some of the key symbols to remember are: 

- {} or ∅ (the empty set)
- x ∈ S (set membership)
- A = B (set equality)
- A ⊆ B (improper subset)
- A ⊂ B (proper subset)

Set comprehension correspond to loop constructs in programming languages. Some languages actually support comprehensions directly. 

Finally, Venn Diagrams can be used as pictorial representation for sets.
