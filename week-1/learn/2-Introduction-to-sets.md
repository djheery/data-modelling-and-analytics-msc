# Introduction to Sets 

To learn about Entity Relationship Modelling (ERM) & Databases you need to learn about sets.

## What is a set?

A set is a grouping of objects of some type.
Examples of this could be: 

- Students 
- Coins 
- DVDs

A Set is the simplest construct that exists in mathematics. 
It is a collection of things, which are called the members of a set. 
It has no other properties. Therefore, sequences and bags are not sets.

Traditionally the contents of a set are written enclosed in curly brackets. 

In mathematics a set can be a collection of any kind of objects. For example: 

{a book, a building, a bus ticket, a person}

"A collection whose values are ordered in a sequence, while a 'collection' with duplicates is referred to as a bag (or multi set)

## Sets and Set Membership 

In computing, sets are invariably constrained to be typed sets.
This means that the members of a set must be constrained to a specific type. 

For example: 

Cars: {Ford, Ferrari, Skoda}
Age: {1, 200, 50}
Money: {1.50, 1.80}

Above the types are : String, int, float

The elements or members are seperated by "and".

Students and Money are the names of these sets 

## Example Sets 

Heather is a member of the set Students. Formally this is written:

Heather ∈ Students

Amy is not a member of students. Formally this is written: 

Amy ∉ Students.

Some more examples: 

c ∉ {a, b, c, d} :: This is false
f ∉ {a, b, c, d} :: This is true
a ∈ {a, b. c, d} :: This is true 
d ∈ {a, b. c, d} :: This is true

Notice how the sets have not been given names, this is known as literal sets.
