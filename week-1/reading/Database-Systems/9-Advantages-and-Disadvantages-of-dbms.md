# The Advantages and disadvantages of DBMSs

Advantages: 

  ## Control of data redundancy
    - Less duplication of data entries cause by file-based systems.
    - Similar data such as rent, address, can have their own columns and relationships. 
    - This does not eliminate redundancy entirely,  but controls the amount of redundancy inherent in the database. 
      - Sometimes it is necessary to duplicate key data items to model relationships. Other times it is necessary to improve performance.

  ## Data Consistency 
    - By eliminating or controlling redundancy we reduce the risk of inconsistencies occurring. If a data item is stored only once in the database, any update to its value has to be performed on only one item, and the new value is available immediately
  
  ## More Information from the Same Amount of Data 
    -With the integration from of the operational data, it may be possible for the organization to derive additional information from the same data.
  
  ## Sharing Data
    - A centralized database allows data from different departments to be shared, improving business operation.
