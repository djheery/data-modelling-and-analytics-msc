Database Approach
=================

All the limitations of the File-Based Approach can be attributed to two factors 
  - The definition of the data is embedded in the application programs, rather than being stored separately and independently 
  - There is no control over the access and manipulation of data beyond that imposed by the application programs 

This is where the database and Database Management System emerged. 

Database 
  - A shared collection of logically related data and its description, designed to meet the information needs of an organization.

A database is a single, usually large reporistory of data
  - Can be used simultaneously by many departments. 
  - Minimum amount of duplication 
  -Holds not only the organizations operational data but also a descripton of this data 

A database is also defined as: 
  - A self-describing collection of intergrated records. 

- Description of data known as the 
  - System catalog 
  - Data Dictionary 
  - Meta data 
    - "Data about data"

The approach to data definition is similar to the approach taken in modern software development 
  - External definition of an object and a separate external definition are provded. 
  - Users only see the external definition and have the schematic of the object abstracted away from them 
    - Known as Data abstraction. 
    - This is why we can cahnge the structure of data without the user needing to know about it. 
    - If new data structures are added or existing data structures modified, then the application programs are unnafected. However, if we remove a field from a file that an application uses then that application is affected by thsi change and must be modified. 
  
Logically Related 
  - When we analyze the information needs of an organization we attempt to identify entities, attributes and relationships 
    - Entity 
      - A destinct object in the organization that is to be represented 
    - Attribute 
      - Property that describes some aspect of teh object that we wish to record
    - Relationship 
      - Association between entities.
