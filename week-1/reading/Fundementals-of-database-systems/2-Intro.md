Some Example of Use Cases

Purchasing goods from a supermarket 
  - A database will likely be accessed to find the associated product when a barcode is scanned.
    - The reader is linked to a database application that uses the bar code to find out he price of the item. It will then reduce the number of these items in stock after the purchase of the item.
    - If the stock falls below a certain level, the database system may automatically place an order to obtain more of that item. 
    - It the database application may also enable the manual lookup of stock lists and itineraries to determine what has been selling, what hasn't and for customer queries related to the stock of a specific item. 

Purchases using your credit card 
  - When you purchase using your card, there will be a check to see if you have sufficient funds to make the purchase. 
  - This check may be carried out by telephone or automatically by card reader linked to a computer system.
