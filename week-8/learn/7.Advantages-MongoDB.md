# Advantages of MongoDB

There are several advantages to using MongoDB. 
The ones listed in the lecture slide are: 

- Programming Language Compatibility
  - Documents or objects correspond to native data types in many programming languages such as: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript
- Reduced Expensive Joins
  - Embedded Documents and Arrays in MongoDB reduce the need for expensive Joins, which are common place in Relational Databases. 
- Polymorphism and Storage Flexibility
  - The dynamic schema in MongoDB supports fluent Polymorphism. It also makes storage flexible for semi-structured data. 
    - Dynamic schema means that we do not need to define a schema before inserting data into the database 
  - Polymorphism stems from a biological term which means that members of the same population can have different visual characteristics. 
    - Within programming it refers to the ability of the system or language to apply the same function or interface to objects or documents of different data types or structures that are in some way related or inherit from each other. Think back to the subclass/ supercalss in OOP. 
  - MongoDB allows documents with uncommon and common fields to be stored in the same collection
