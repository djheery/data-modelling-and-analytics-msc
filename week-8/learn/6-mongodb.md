# MongoDB: An example of a NOSQL Database and System

MongoDB is a document-based NOSQL system, this system is available as Free-to-use, subscription on-premises and Over the cloud. 

## MongoDB Data Structure: 

A record in MongoDB is a document, where data structure is composed of a key:pair value also known as value pairs.

It looks like a javascript object or JSON.

{
  name: "Daniel",
  age: 28,
  course: ['OOP', 'Secure Web Development', 'Data Modelling & Analytics']
}

The Structure of the data fields in MongoDB documents are chosen based on how documents will be accessed.

You can choose to access them in a normalized or denormalized design.

Take the following code:

db.collection.insert({
  this: 'Hello World'
});

This example is a "document"
It is a string and has not specific structure. 

Now this example:

db.createCollection("Students");

This is a fairly explicit statement. It creates a collection which will presumably store student documents with some internal structure. 

## MongoDB Document Storage


MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects hence their design. 
In MongoDB documents are stored as BSON.

BSON Means Binary JSON format.

Each document in the collection has a unique ID called '_id'. 
This can be generated by the system, or user provided. 

By default it is generated by the system.
