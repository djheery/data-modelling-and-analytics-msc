# Introduction  to NOSQL databases and Systems

What are NOSQL databases? 

NOSQL stands for'**Not Only SQL**'
It is often misunderstood as at a glance people think it means No SQL. It does not mean this.

NOSQL databases focus on:

- Unstructured and semi-structured data storage
- High Performance
- Availability 
- Data Replication 
- Scalability 

Traditional applications generally use Relational Databases. 
Modern tech giants such as Google, Twitter, Amazon and Facebook use NOSQL databases.
