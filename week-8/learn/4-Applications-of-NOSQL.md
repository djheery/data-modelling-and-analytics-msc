# Applications of NOSQL Databases and Systems

Whilst Relational Databases have been the general choice for most applications, in the last decade there has been a demand for databases to deal with massive data sets (Big Data) in an un-normalized form.

This is an issue to RDBs, as they store data in a normalized and structured form. However, Big Data is often un-normalized and unstructred which cannot be dealt with by an RDB. 

This is why companies such as Google and Amazon have decided to use NOSQL database. 

## Typical Applications of NOSQL databases

- Social Media 
  - Data is mostly unstructured or semi-structured
- Web Links
  - Seach engines manage huge volumes of web-linkk well beyond the capability of an RDB.
- User Profiles 
  - Systems with hundreds of millions of users (Facebook, google, amazon)
- Marketing and Sales  
  - Sales data may be structured, however, they are generally interdependent on marketing data, which tends to be semi-structured
- Posts and Tweets 
  - Billions of posts and tweets have been created, storing all of these in an RDB would be limited as they are not easily scalable 
- Road Maps and Spatial Data 
  - By definition, road maps and spatial data are hugely complex and voluminous, mixing natural geographical data with roads, transport links, addresses, services, underground systems and terrain data in a layered fashion.
- Emails
  - Systems such as Gmail or Hotmail have millions of users, each user having hundreds and thousands of emails with and without attachments, contacts and so on, which is clearly an example of huge volumes of semi-structured data.
