# Object Relations & Nested Relations 

## Object Relations

Object based relations (known as object relations) support structured types of attributes. This means that you can have non-atomic attributes. 
Their consist of composite attributes such as struct or user-defined type, arrays and nested relation.

The value of an attribbute could be an entire relation by removing the restriction of first normal form (1NF)

In terms of methods, special operations can bbe defined for and applied to instances of a User-Defined Type (UDT).
Tuples can now play the role of objects. 
Each tuple will have a Unique ID generated by the system
An Attribute can have a value that is a pointer to another object which is how references are used. This allows object sharing. 

## Nested Relations 

Relations that violate the 1NF rule of relational modelling are called nested-relations.
It is also called non-1NF (NFNF) or NF**2 relational model.

Very limited features are offered such as composite attribbutes and nested relation, where the value of an attribute can be an entire relation. 

NRM does not support obbject sharing and an NRM-based system supports new algebraic operations for manipulating nested-relations.

Nest means to convert 1NF into NF2, whereas unnest means to convert NF2 into 1NF.
